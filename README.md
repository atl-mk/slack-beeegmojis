# Slack BEEEG emojis

This is designed for Slack 4.11

## Installation

### Desktop app (macOS, GNU+Linux, and Windows)

#### script

Run either `setup` for the BEEEEEG version or `setup-beeeg-E-smolz` for the BEEG version or `setup-smol` for the smol version. If you're running macOS then it will help you by installing Homebrew and Node.js

#### npx (deprecated method)

This method is unlikely to work because of the permissions needed to modify the Slack application files.

### Browsers (Firefox, Chrome, and Edge)
